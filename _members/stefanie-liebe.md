I have a multi-disciplinary background with degrees in psychology, medicine and neuroscience. As a psychologist I understand cognitive concepts, experimental paradigms and procedures to investigate cognitive functions at the behavioural and neuropsychological level. As a neuroscientist I gained technical expertise in electrophysiological measurements and examination of neural data which includes both classical neuroscientific data analysis tools as well as advanced machine learning methods. As a clinician I am familiar with neurological disorders with a specific focus in epilepsy and the interdisciplinary, sometimes challenging nature of carrying out invasive neurophysiological recordings in epilepsy patients that involves the highly collaborative work of clinical experts from neurology, neurosurgery, neuroradiology as well as neuropsychology. Overall, I enjoy working with clinicians, experimental neuroscientists and computational scientists in close collaborations.
