# Dr. Stefanie Liebe: Academic and Research Background

Dr. Stefanie Liebe is a Clinician Scientist and medical resident in Epileptology and Neurology, currently affiliated with the University Clinic Tübingen's Department for Neurology and Epileptology and the Cluster of Excellence 'Machine Learning for Science' in Tübingen, Germany. She has a multi-disciplinary background with degrees in psychology, medicine, and neuroscience. As a psychologist, she understands cognitive concepts, experimental paradigms, and procedures to investigate cognitive functions at the behavioral and neuropsychological level. As a neuroscientist, she has gained technical expertise in electrophysiological measurements and the examination of neural data, including both classical neuroscientific data analysis tools and advanced machine learning methods. As a clinician, she is familiar with neurological disorders, with a specific focus on epilepsy, and the interdisciplinary, sometimes challenging nature of carrying out invasive neurophysiological recordings in epilepsy patients. This involves the highly collaborative work of clinical experts from neurology, neurosurgery, neuroradiology, as well as neuropsychology. Overall, she enjoys working with clinicians, experimental neuroscientists, and computational scientists in close collaborations.
