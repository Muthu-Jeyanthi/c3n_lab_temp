### Cognitive and Clinical Computational Neuroscience (CÂ³N) Lab 
### We are interested in cognitive neuroscience research related to vision and memory, while maintaining a close relationship to clinical applications with the potential to provide transferrable insights for understanding neurological disorders with a specific focus on epilepsy. To this end, we use novel machine-learning methods, and in particular artificial neural networks, to analyse and interpret measurements of neural activity and behaviour.
