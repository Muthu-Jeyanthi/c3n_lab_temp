## Multimodal Analysis of Epilepsy for Improved Patient Outcomes
{% include section.html %}

{% capture text %}
__Seizure Description Language Mapping__
We use unstructured text descriptions of seizures from focal drug-resistant epilepsy patients to map semiological behaviors to brain regions. We obtain likelihood estimates linking seizure descriptions to seizure-generating areas and evaluate the language model's performance, confidence, reasoning, and citation abilities compared to clinical evaluation.

__Seizure Behavior Mapping using Pose Estimation__
We analyze patient videos during seizures, perform pose estimation to obtain behavior trajectories, and map them to EEG signals to identify neural correlates. This provides insights into seizure-related behaviors and their relationship to brain activity.

__Automated Multimodal Seizure Behavior Detection and Reporting__
We develop an AI-based multimodal approach to automatically detect seizure-related behaviors and distinguish them from regular behavior using videos. We also generate descriptive reports on the recorded behaviors and subtypes to track disease prognosis in the facility.
