## Neural interaction during context dependent visual processing in the human medial temporal lobe 
{% include section.html %}

{% capture text %}
The goal of the project is to investigate and disentangle the functional contribution of feedforward and feedback signalling during contextual manipulation across several regions within the human medial temporal lobe â€“ the parahippocampal cortex, the hippocampal formation and the amygdala. We aim to answer the following question: Is task modulation accompanied by changes in the magnitude and direction of interareal interaction engaging specific partners within the MTL network that is dependent on their known functional specializations? We will use pairwise analyses of spike trains and LFPs from human MTL to investigate oscillatory synchrony between areas known to support contextual influences between neural ensembles. We will further discern how feedforward and feedback signaling contributes to contextual modulation at the neuronal population level using multivariate measures. Lastly, using data-constrained recurrent neural network modeling of multi-region neural activity we plan to assess directed functional interactions between these regions.

## Multimodal Analysis of Epilepsy for Improved Patient Outcomes
{% include section.html %}

{% capture text %}
__Seizure Description Language Mapping__
We use unstructured text descriptions of seizures from focal drug-resistant epilepsy patients to map semiological behaviors to brain regions. We obtain likelihood estimates linking seizure descriptions to seizure-generating areas and evaluate the language model's performance, confidence, reasoning, and citation abilities compared to clinical evaluation.

__Seizure Behavior Mapping using Pose Estimation__
We analyze patient videos during seizures, perform pose estimation to obtain behavior trajectories, and map them to EEG signals to identify neural correlates. This provides insights into seizure-related behaviors and their relationship to brain activity.

__Automated Multimodal Seizure Behavior Detection and Reporting__
We develop an AI-based multimodal approach to automatically detect seizure-related behaviors and distinguish them from regular behavior using videos. We also generate descriptive reports on the recorded behaviors and subtypes to track disease prognosis in the facility.

## Modelling neurophysiological correlates of spatial hearing using a deep neural network model
{% include section.html %}

{% capture text %}
In this project, we simulate Sound-Localization (SL) in normal hearing individuals and CI-users using a computational model which include deep neural networks.
Based on simulations, a predictive link between neural computations, behavioural as well as electrophysiological results is established. By comparing network performance for spatial hearing in normal hearing vs CI similarities and distinctions between computations performed in both groups will be identified. Results will be used to design new devices and training procedures for CI-rehabilitation.
